# sc.urban-golf.ch
Simple but useful Urban Golf score card application.

## Missing features to discuss
- Store existing holes as simple json list
  - Name
  - Geo location
  - Maybe a detail description how to play this specific hole
- Select from a static list of existing holes where you play next
- Store player data linked to an exisiting hole for statistics
- Add possibility to login with an exisiting account
  - Simple and easy
  - No user cookie handling if possible
  - Maybe use Azure B2C with existing php library MSAL?

## Deployment challenges
- How to run application locally without a valid database?
